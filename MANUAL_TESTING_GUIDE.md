   - Password: `password123`
4. Click "Create Account"
5. **Expected:** Auto-login and redirect to home page

**Step 2: Request a Ride**
1. On home page, fetch location or enter manually
2. Enter destination (e.g., "Mumbai Airport")

**Step 3: Select Vehicle & Confirm Booking**
1. Click on desired vehicle (e.g., CAR)
2. Click "Confirm Booking"
3. **Expected:** Success message with booking ID
4. **Result:** Booking created with status PENDING

---

### Scenario 2: Driver Registration & Ride Acceptance

**Step 1: Register as Driver**
1. Go to http://localhost:5173/register
2. Toggle to "Driver" mode
3. Fill form:
   - Name: `Raj Kumar`
   - Email: `driver123@test.com`
   - Password: `password123`
   - Vehicle Type: `CAR`
4. Click "Create Account"
5. **Expected:** Auto-login and redirect to driver dashboard

**Step 2: View Pending Rides**
1. On driver dashboard, toggle "Go Online"

3. **Note:** Only CAR rides will appear for a CAR driver

**Step 3: Accept a Ride**
1. Click "Accept" button on a pending ride
2. **Expected:** Ride status changes to "Accepted"
3. **Auto-completion:** After 5 seconds, booking auto-completes
4. **Result:** Driver wallet is credited with fare amount

**Step 4: Check Earnings**
1. Scroll to "Total Earnings" section
2. **Expected:** Wallet shows updated balance with newly earned fare

---

### Scenario 3: Multiple Drivers (Vehicle Type Filtering)

**Test Vehicle Type Matching:**

1. Register 3 drivers with different vehicles:
   - Driver 1: BIKE
   - Driver 2: AUTO
   - Driver 3: CAR

2. Create bookings as a user:
   - Booking 1: CAR (5.5km)
   - Booking 2: AUTO (3km)
   - Booking 3: BIKE (1km)

3. Login as each driver:
   - **BIKE Driver:** Only sees "Booking 3" (BIKE rides)
   - **AUTO Driver:** Only sees "Booking 2" (AUTO rides)
   - **CAR Driver:** Only sees "Booking 1" (CAR rides)

4. **Expected:** Each driver sees only matching vehicle type bookings

---

### Scenario 4: Fare Calculation Verification

**Test Fare Accuracy:**

1. For distance = 5.5 km:
   - BIKE: ₹(5 × 5.5) + (5 × 5.5)min = **₹27.50 + 27.5min**
   - AUTO: ₹(8 × 5.5) + (7 × 5.5)min = **₹44 + 38.5min**
   - CAR: ₹(12 × 5.5) + (10 × 5.5)min = **₹66 + 55min**

2. Request ride and verify displayed fares match above

3. **Expected:** Calculations are accurate

## API Testing via Terminal

### Test All Endpoints with Node.js

```bash
# 1. User Registration
node -e "
const http = require('http');
const data = JSON.stringify({name: 'TestUser', email: 'test@test.com', password: 'test123'});
const options = {
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 5000,
  path: '/auth/register',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Content-Length': data.length
  }
};
const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
  let body = '';
  res.on('data', chunk => body += chunk);
  res.on('end', () => {
    console.log('✅ Registration:', JSON.parse(body).ok ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILED');
  });
});
req.write(data);
req.end();
"

# 2. User Login
node -e "
const http = require('http');
const data = JSON.stringify({email: 'test@test.com', password: 'test123'});
const options = {
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: 5000,
  path: '/auth/login',
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Content-Length': data.length
  }
};
const req = http.request(options, (res) => {
  let body = '';
  res.on('data', chunk => body += chunk);
  res.on('end', () => {
    const result = JSON.parse(body);
    console.log('✅ Login:', result.ok ? 'SUCCESS' : 'FAILED');
    console.log('   Role:', result.user.role);
  });
});
req.write(data);
req.end();
"
```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### "Network Error" on Login/Register

**Issue:** Form shows "Network Error"

**Solutions:**
1. Check backend is running: `netstat -ano | findstr :5000`
2. Check MongoDB is running: `netstat -ano | findstr :27017`
3. Clear browser cache: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
4. Try fresh registration with new email

---

### Ride Not Appearing for Driver

**Issue:** Driver dashboard shows no pending rides

**Check:**
1. Ensure driver's `vehicleType` matches booking's `vehicleType`
2. Ensure booking status is "PENDING" (not already accepted)
3. Check driver is "Online" (toggle enabled)

---

### Booking Not Auto-Completing

**Issue:** Booking stays in "ACCEPTED" state after 5 seconds

**Check:**
1. Browser tab is active (auto-completion runs in background)
2. Backend logs show the completion process
3. Check network tab for any failed requests

---

## Database Inspection

### View Test Data

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB
mongosh

# List databases
show dbs

# Use rideApp database
use rideApp

# View collections
show collections

# Check users
db.users.find().pretty()

# Check drivers
db.drivers.find().pretty()

# Check bookings
db.bookings.find().pretty()

# Check earnings
db.drivers.find({}, {name: 1, walletBalance: 1}).pretty()
```
